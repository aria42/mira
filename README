- train data-path num-iters model-outfile [trains model spits it out to model-outfile]
- predict model-infile test-data-path  [writes one-per-line predictions to stdout]
- test model-infile test-data-path [computes error of model on data in test-data-path]

Format of labeled data: Each line looks like
"label feat1:val1 feat2:val2 ... featN:valN"
where feati is any string and vali is a double. 

Format of unlabeled data: Each line looks like
